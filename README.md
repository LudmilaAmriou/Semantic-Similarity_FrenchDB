# Semantic-Similarity
LSI : is an NLP pretrained model that helped us implement a document similarity analyzer on french and english articles taken from a specific Database. 
To make this code work, one needs to adjust the code according to their Database structure.
The Database is read and put in a list of dictionaries.
